rob pike said you were looking at 630ld, or whatever the 30 equiv. of 32ld is
called.  I made some shortenings & simplifications of 32ld which might interest
you, they are in /n/giacobini/usr/reeds/jerq/32ld.  Some of the code there is
solely for 'secure unix', but a lot it just cleaning up & scab-picking.
