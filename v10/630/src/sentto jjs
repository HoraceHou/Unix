Subject: PostScript Interpreter for 630 Terminals

Lorinda,
    Peter Nelson told me that you use a PostScript interpreter for the 630
terminal as part of your "reader" software.  I'm writing some PostScript
scripts and I'd much prefer debugging them on the screen instead of waiting
for the pages to print (or not print).  Can you supply me with the interpreter
and some instructions on how to set it up and use it, or a pointer to
someone who can?  Thanks.
