.XE "exit()"
.SH NAME
exit \- cease execution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B void exit ( );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I exit
function
terminates a process.
Calling
.I exit
replaces the running process with the default terminal program.
When a process calls
.IR exit ,
all local resources [keyboard, mouse, storage, etc.]
are deallocated automatically.
Any associated \s-1UNIX\s+1 system process must
be terminated separately.
.PP
Exit is called automatically when an application program
returns from main( ).
.PP
When dmdio.h is included,
.I exit
acts differently.
In addition to the above, it will terminate the host side of
.IR jx .
Therefore, exit must be called
.br
explicitly by a process downloaded with
.I jx
to terminate the host side.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following code fragment shows how a process can exit
when a ``q'' is typed.

#include <dmd.h>

main()
{
     char c;
 
     request (KBD);

     if ( (c = kbdchar()) == 'q')
             exit();
     .
