this command should never die, should not be easilly blockable

should figure out what licenses to keep when.  master & forks both need
setlic.  master doesnt need u?  fork doesnt need x?  fork doesnt need n?
(writing to log file...as soon as connection established, fork can copy
label)
[I sure wish nochk was the other way round!]

set up user execution env: 
		uid, gid,
		labels
			get proc label from tty
			but how to adapt to client's ceiling?
			need to clear fixity bits
		logname,
		pgrp	(little dance for ps)
	these cannot be learned from untrusted agent:
		working directory?
		umask?

timeouts in pex bids for priv file updating, checking.

ONE PAIN IN THE NECK, INSTALLING NEW VERSIONS!!!
