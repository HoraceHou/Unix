This is the /usr file system for ix, shorn of most
material that may be copied bodily from research unix
(v8,v9,v10).

./root is a copy of the root file system.

As ix uses a different size inode, it will take considerable
work to bring the stuff up; you must begin with mkfs.
Single-user mode has all privileges but still requires
the lmask feature of nosh to exercise them.
Other advice is in ./man and ./src/doc.

A listing of appropriate security-label settings is given in
./adm/cl.out.  Devices are listed only to reveal existence;
their labels are supplied automatically (U is unusable).
Set unlisted labels to:
	directories mentioned ------ ------F  0000 ...
	other directories     ------ ------F  ffff 0000 ...
	files                 ------ ------   ffff 0000 ...
"Mentioned" means mentioned in any path.
Funny uids (mostly reeds or doug) may be understood to be bin.

You can run with labeling off by fooling with labinit.

Because most contents of /dev are unreadable, its contents
are largely excised.  Here is what existed there at shutdown.
