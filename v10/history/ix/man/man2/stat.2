.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Stat
puts detailed information about the file
.I name
in a structure whose address is
.IR buf .
.I Lstat
does the same except when
.I name
is a symbolic
link (see
.IR link (2)),
in which case it
supplies information about the link itself.
.I Fstat
does the same for an open file
known by a file descriptor.
.PP
It is unnecessary to have any
permissions at all with respect to
.IR name ,
but all directories
leading to the file must be searchable.

For reasons of efficiency,
.B st_atime
is not set when a directory
is searched, although this might be more logical.

.PP
.B S_IFMT
and
.B S_ICCTYP
are field masks; the other constants encode modes.
Codes contained in the 
.B S_IFMT
field are mutually exclusive.
Codes containing bit 01000 are incompatible with other
codes contained in the
.B S_ICCTYP
field.
.PP
.I Fstat,
which reads the inode,
and
.IR write (2)
can be performed on the same file descriptor only if
the security labels of file and process reach the same value
or if the process has capability
