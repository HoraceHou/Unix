INTRODUCTION

Here is a summary of the current information at the CSNET Coordination
and Information Center (CIC) about addresses for CSNET PhoneNet users.
Networks covered are DARPA Internet (CSNET X25Net, Arpanet, Milnet,
etc.), CSNET PhoneNet, Australia, Bell Labs, BITNET, Canada, DEC ENET,
France, MAILNET, UUCP, UK, and Xerox.

Please note that the use of the DARPA Internet is restricted to
authorized individuals and is regulated by the Defense Communications
Agency.  (See info-4 in REFERENCES).

Send corrections and additions to the CIC Service Host (which is on the
Internet):

	cic@sh.cs.net		RFC822 new domain-style address
	cic@csnet-sh.arpa	RFC822 "arpa"-style address
	cic@csnet-sh		RFC733 address


RFC822 ADDRESSES AND DOMAINS

All Internet hosts use RFC822-style addresses.  Broadly speaking, this
means that they can handle addresses that contain dots ("."s) to the right
of the "@".

The Internet is currently in the process of changing to a "domain"
system of mail addresses.  During the transition, the Internet hosts
that have not yet adopted new domain-style names are given the temporary
top (rightmost) domain ".arpa".  Almost all Internet hosts that are not
brand-new and that have registered for new domain-style names also
retain ".arpa" names as aliases.

A domain name, unlike the older forms of addresses, is a simply a name.
A domain does not include information about the route that a message
must travel in order to reach its destination.  This information must be
supplied in some other way.  The two methods now in use are (1) host
tables, such as the "hosts.txt" table supplied by the Internet Network
Information Center (NIC), and (2) domain servers, which can be used only
on Internet hosts because they must interact with domain servers on
other hosts.

In the domain system, the most general form of address can be
represented as:

    local-part@domain		Examples:	     dan@oxbridge.edu
                                            	diane@cs.oxbridge.edu
					  dick@sun15.ccc.oxbridge.edu
					     dennis%vax1@oxbridge.edu

The "local-part", to the left of the "@", may be simply the user-id, or
it may be any form of local address that is recognized within the
domain.  The "domain", to the right of the "@", may be a second-level
domain (representing an organization) followed by a top-level domain, or
it may contain several layers of subdomains.

Top-level domains represent general classes of organizations.  The top-
level domains that have been registered by the DDN NIC for use by US 
organizations are:

	    COM  (commercial)	   NET	(network administration)  
	    EDU  (educational)	   ORG	(nonprofit)       
	    GOV  (government)      ARPA (Arpanet, to be   
	    MIL	 (military)	      	 phased out)                 

Top-level domains for countries are:

	AU	Australia	JP	Japan	  
	CA	Canada		KR	Republic of Korea
        CH      Switzerland     NL	Netherlands
	DE      West Germany    NZ	New Zealand
	FI      Finland         SE	Sweden
	FR	France		UK	United Kingdom
	IL	Israel		US	United States

Not all of these domains are in use.  The top-level domain, US, for
the United States has not yet its use defined by the DDN NIC.  In the
future, other countries will register official top-level domains with
the DDN NIC.

Relay.cs.net recognizes the informal domain ".csnet" for PhoneNet
sites that have not yet registered for second-level domains.  Some
other informal domains also recognized.  Addresses with these domains
are always rewritten by relay.cs.net:

    BITNET                  CHUNET (Switzerland)     OZ   (OZ.AU) 
    CDN   (Canada)          JUNET  (JAPAN)           UUCP         

Examples: 
    andrew@munnari.oz      -->  andrew@munnari.oz.au
    rmxj@cornella.bitnet   -->  rmxj%cornella.bitnet@wiscvm.wicv.edu

The ".csnet" informal domain is being phased out as PhoneNet hosts adopt
domain-style names.  Many PhoneNet hosts allow users to send messages
with the informal ".csnet" domain, and translate it to "@relay.cs.net".

Example:
    cheryl@camford.csnet   -->   cheryl%camford.csnet@relay.cs.net

However, it is not correct to add ".csnet" at the end of a domain-style
address, even though the domain is a PhoneNet site.   The rule is, if 
the address of a PhoneNet site contains a "." to the right of the "@", 
DO NOT add ".csnet".


RFC733 ADDRESSES

A few CSNET PhoneNet sites still use the RFC733 form, based on the NIC
document RFC733:

	user@host		Example: laura@oxbridge        

For these sites, relay.cs.net does the necessary translation between 
RFC733 and RFC822 style addresses.  (The CIC strongly urges organizations
on CSNET PhoneNet to change to RFC822 style addresses in preparation for
applying for second-level domain names.)


==========================================================================

SENDING MAIL ON AN "822" HOST (INTERNET OR PHONENET)

...to and from hosts with domain-style names (including "host.arpa"):
                         
Internet -> PhoneNet:      user%domain@relay.cs.net

Internet -> Non-US X25Net: user%domain@relay.cs.net

Internet -> Internet:      user@domain                

PhoneNet -> PhoneNet:      user@domain

PhoneNet -> Non-US X25Net: user@domain

PhoneNet -> Internet:      user@domain

When the transition to the domain-style names is complete, top-level
domains will no longer indicate the physical network.  Internet, 
X25Net and Phonenet hosts will all be addressed as user@domain.

At the present time, not all Internet hosts are able to send messages
correctly to hosts with domain-style names that must be routed through
relay.cs.net or other gateways.  For this reason, although it may seem
like a step backward, relay.cs.net rewrites domain-style PhoneNet addresses
in the same way that it rewrites non-domain-style PhoneNet addresses:

        joanne@oxbridge.edu   -->   joanne%oxbridge.edu@relay.cs.net
       	craig@camford.csnet   -->   craig%camford.csnet@relay.cs.net
       	janet@camford	      -->   janet%camford.csnet@relay.cs.net


...to and from PhoneNet hosts without domains:

Internet -> PhoneNet   user%site.csnet@relay.cs.net

Phonenet -> PhoneNet   user@site.csnet


...to and from other networks  

Internet -> Australia  user%host.oz@relay.cs.net
			 Note: See sites-11 in REFERENCES.
                         Queries may be sent to postmaster@australia.

Australia -> InterNet  user%domain@relay.cs.net

Internet -> Bell Labs  user.system%btl.csnet@relay.cs.net
                         Note: Users sufficiently close to the btl gateway
			 can be reached as "user%btl.csnet@relay.cs.net".

Bell Labs -> Internet  user@domain

Internet -> BITNET     user%host.bitnet@wiscvm.wisc.edu
			 Note: See sites-5 and -6 in REFERENCES.

BITNET   -> Internet   BSMTP with "user@host.arpa"
                         Note: See adr-8 in REFERENCES.  WISCVM does not 
                         yet have access to a domain server and hence 
                         cannot handle all domain-style names.
                      
Internet -> CDNnet     user%mta-name.cdn@relay.cs.net

CDNnet   -> Internet   host%domain@ubc.cdn
			 Note: See sites-14 in REFERENCES.
	  
Internet -> DEC ENET   user@host.dec.com

DEC ENET -> Internet   RHEA::DECWRL::"user@subdomain.domain"
                         for domain = ARPA, ATHENA (project at MIT),
                         BITNET, CSNET(PhoneNet), MAILNET, and OZ
                         (Australia), but not UUCP.
                      
Internet -> France     user%host.cosac%france.csnet@relay.cs.net
			 Note: See sites-13 in REFERENCES.

Internet -> Japan      user%host.junet@relay.cs.net

Internet -> MAILNET    user%host.mailnet@mit-multics.arpa

MAILNET  -> Internet   user%domain@Mit-Multics

Internet -> UK	       user@subdomain.AC.UK

UK       -> Internet   user@domain
                         Note: The UK uses a domain system that is
			 "backwards" from the Internet form. The gateway
			 host, cs.ucl.ac.uk (US style), also known as
			 uk.ac.ucl.cs (UK style), translates the headers.
			 Beware of addresses in the body of a message.

Internet -> UUCP       hostz!...!hostb!hosta!user@ucbvax.edu or
		       user%host.UUCP@harvard.harvard.edu 
                         Note: "hosta" is the recipient's host.  The
			 sender must specify a UUCP routing path
			 between "hosta" and "hostz", a host with a
			 direct connection to some UUCP->Internet
			 gateway, such as "ucbvax.edu" (berkeley) or
			 "harvard.harvard.edu".  Harvard is uses
			 "pathalias" software to construct a UUCP
			 routing address.  

UUCP -> Internet       hostb!...!hostz!berkeley!user@domain or
		       hostb!...!hostz!harvard!user@domain 
                         Note: "hostb" is the sender's nearest
			 neighbor.  The sender must specify a UUCP
			 routing path between "hostb" and "hostz", a
			 host with a direct connection to some
			 UUCP->Internet gateway, such as "berkeley" or
			 "harvard".  Some hosts cannot parse "hybrid"
			 addresses that contain both "!" and "@".

Internet -> VNET (IBM) user@ibm.com
                          Note: In the past, ibm.com accepted addresses 
                          of the form user%host@ibm.com, but these are 
                          now rejected.

Internet -> XEROX      user.registry@Xerox.com
                          Note: Do not use "%" between user and registry.
                          Some Xerox registries are "pa" and "wbst".

XEROX    -> Internet   user@domain
