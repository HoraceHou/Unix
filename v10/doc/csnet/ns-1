NS 3.1

The central CSNET User Name Server, Version 3.1, on the service host, 
SH.CS.NET, is a directory database of users and hosts.  

Any CSNET host that runs the UNIX operating system (BSD 4.1 or 4.2)
may receive "Local Agent" software for the User Name Server, at no
extra charge.  Version 3.1 of the Local Agent Software, initially
available only for 4.2, was released in September 1985.  This version
combines the "nicknames" and "mail forwarding" enhancements previously
announced as Phase II and Phase III.

On sites with Local Agent software, the 'ns' command runs the User
Name Server, which allows you to compose queries or register new users
interactively.  Requests are sent to the central Name Server on
SH.CS.NET by electronic mail, and the responses are automatically
mailed back.  On X25Net or Arpanet hosts, the 'ns' program on the
local host connects directly to the central User Name Server, and
response is immediate.


WHO CAN REGISTER?

A CSNET host is a host computer at a CSNET site (i.e., a CSNET member
organization) which is able to send mail to the CSNET.  Each CSNET
site has one, or at most two, CSNET hosts which have been designated
as official CSNET hosts.  On Phonenet sites, the offical CSNET hosts
are the only hosts with direct access to the CSNET.  The official
hosts may act as gateways between the CSNET and other host computers
within the member organization.  This is particularly important when
none of the other hosts is on the X25Net or Arpanet.  

Only the official CSNET hosts are registered as "site entries" in the
Name Server, but all users at any CSNET host are eligible to register
in the CSNET User Name Server.


HOW-TO MESSAGES

CSNET Info Documents ns-2 through ns-7 explain how you can query the
User Name Server, register yourself as a new user, and edit your entry
from different types of hosts.  Document ns-8 briefly describes the
new features of Version 3.1.


ns-2.  QUERY with Local Agent or TELNET (Arpanet/X25Net)

        If you are at an X25Net or Arpanet site, you can query the
        central User Name Server interactively through Local Agent
	Software or by direct TELNET connection.  If you are at a
	PHONENET site, you can use the Local Agent Software
	interactively; responses from the central User Name Server are
	returned by electronic mail.

ns-3.  QUERY by Electronic Mail.

        If your CSNET site has no Local Agent Software and no TELNET
	access you can send and receive queries by electronic mail.
	You can use this technique on any X25Net or Arpanet site when
	you want the results of your queries in message form.

ns-4.  REGISTER on Hosts with Local Agent Software.

        Automatic registration requires the use of Local Agent
        Software so that you can be authenticated by your login
        identity.  Although you can query the central User Name Server
	over a direct TELNET connection, you cannot register yourself
	as a new user.  This is a matter of both policy and technical
        considerations.

ns-5.  REGISTER Non-Local Users with Local Agent Software.

        If your host does not run the Local Agent Software but the the
	software is installed on another CSNET host at your site, your
	local Technical Liaison can register you.

ns-6.  REGISTER by Electronic Mail.

	If none of the hosts at your CSNET site run the Local Agent
	software, your Technical Liaison can send User Name Server
	registrations by electronic mail to the CIC@CSNET-CIC.

ns-7.  EDIT Your Registration, MOVE to Another Host.

        You can edit your registration using Local Agent Software on
        the original host at any time.  Your CSNET password allows you
	to edit your entry on any host that has Local Agent Software,
	or by telnetting to the central User Name Server, on SH.CS.NET
	and using the 'ns' login.  If your move to another host, you
	can use your CSNET password to move your User Name Server
	identity.  This is important if you use the nickname feature.

ns-8.  Nicknames and Mail Forwarding

	With Local Agent Software, you can define personal "nicknames"
	for addresses or lists, with the Local Agent Software.  If you
	define nicknames for people, and if those people transfer
	their accounts to other CSNET hosts and use the MOVE command
	to change their NS entries, the Local Agent Software will
	automatically forward messages to them.
