******************************************************************************
CSNET Coordination and Information Center (CIC)        Hotline: (617) 873-2777
10 Moulton Street, Cambridge, MA 02138                   Email:  cic@sh.cs.net
                Info-Server requests to: info-server@sh.cs.net

            'HELP' FOR REQUEST 'INFO' IN THE CSNET INFO-SERVER

REQUEST: INFO is a set of CSNET general information documents.  See
below for a list of topics.


    *****************************************************************
    *                          IMPORTANT                            *
    *  To prevent failed messages from causing infinite loops, the  *
    *  mail address 'cic@sh.cs.net' is placed in the From: and      *
    *  Reply-To: field of the documents sent by the automated Info- *
    *  Server.  But please do NOT use 'cic@sh.cs.net' when you      *
    *  order documents from the automated Info-Server.  You should  *
    *  send document requests to 'info-server@sh.cs.net'.           *
    *****************************************************************

There are several REQUEST collections, each with its own HELP document:
They are: CALENDAR, FTP, INFO, CREN, NSFNET, RFC, MOD-SOURCES.  

An example request to 'info-server@sh.cs.net' is:

        request: INFO
        TOPIC: HElp
	request: end

Requests are insensitive to case and the number of spaces on a line.

For detailed information about REQUEST categories, using the
Info-Server, including splitting large messages, and for FTP
instructions for Internet users, see the end of this message.

You are encouraged to suggest additional documents you would like to
have available from the CSNET Info-Server.

Thank you.
 
The CSNET Staff

 			   "REQUEST" CATEGORIES

REQUEST: CALENDAR     Information about meetings and conferences of 
                      interest to the Internet community, by month.

REQUEST: FTP          (Currently not available.)
                      The EMAIL-FTP service will be provided by CSNET for
		      sites that do not have FTP access to the Internet.
		      This service is temporarily down for repairs.  
		      When it is back in service, we will announce it
		      in CSNET-FORUM and in this help document.

REQUEST: INFO         CSNET general information documents.  We are in the
                      process of switching from document numbers, e.g.,
                      'sites-1' to document names, e.g., 'csnet-sites'.
                      In the near future, we will drop the document numbers
                      and place the listing of info documents in a separate
                      INDEX file.  Even so, we will continue to recognize
                      and honor the document numbers from older help files.

REQUEST: CREN         Documents about CREN (Corporation for Research and
		      Educational Networking.  Board List, Board Minutes,
		      and documents about the BITNET-CSNET merger.

REQUEST: NSFNET       NSFNET general information documents.

REQUEST: RFC          Documents in the 'Request for Comments' series
                      published by the DDN Network Information Center
                      (NIC).  We don't stock all of them but we will
		      try to get any you want if we don't have them.
                      Document names are 'rfcnnn' where 'nnn' is
                      the report number.  Last topic: rfc1138

REQUEST: MOD-SOURCES  (or MOD.SOURCES) An archive collection of public-
		      domain programs from from the 'mod.sources' mailing
		      list, distributed by USENET netnews. These Unix
		      source files have been selected and tested by the
		      mod.sources moderator. Send for the topics HELP and
		      INDEX. 


               GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INFO-SERVER

The CSNET Info-Server is an automatic program that delivers information
by electronic mail.  To order a document from the Info-Server, send a
message to 'INFO-SERVER@sh.cs.net'. You do not need a subject field. The 
text of your message must be in a special format, such as:

     REQUEST: INFO
      TOPIC: HELP
      TOPIC: ADR-3
     REQUEST: END

This request asks for two documents 'HELP' and 'ADR-3' from the
collection 'INFO'. Your message must have a 'REQUEST' line, and one or
more 'TOPIC:' lines to specify one or more documents.  The line
'REQUEST: END' is optional; it tells the Info-server to ignore the rest
of the message.

To send documents to an address that is different from the address in
your From: field, please include a Reply-to: field in the header of
your message.  Do NOT include a Reply-to: or Acknowledge-to: field in
the body of the message -- the Info-Server won't recognize them.

For each request message, the Info-Server generates a receipt message
which includes the list of documents sent, a report of errrors in the
request, and, if a Reply-to: field is used, the address in the From: 
field of the request message.

You may combine different requests in the same message, and use any
combination of upper- and lower-case letters in your text.  You may also
include or omit spaces and tabs, use any number of REQUEST and TOPIC
lines, and omit 'REQUEST: END'.

        REQUEST     : info
          byte-limit: 22000
          topic:      tbl-4a         (Byte-limit in effect; see below)
         TOPIC:       ml-2
        Request :     rfc
          TOPIC  :    rfc822         (Byte-limit not in effect)

If you include 'REQUEST: END', the Info-Server will ignore whatever
follows in your message.  If you include 'REQUEST: ATTENTION', the INFO
SERVER will ignore whatever follows and deliver your entire message to
'cic@sh.cs.net'.  (This conforms to MOSIS; we prefer that you send
ordinary questions directly to 'cic@sh.cs.net.)


            IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LARGE MESSAGES

The CSNET Info-Server is now set to split transmit documents with a
maximum size of 49000 bytes (49K bytes).  The reason is that some
important mail gateways reject messages longer than an arbitrary limit,
and others have difficulty with long messages from time to time.

You may specify a limit, in lines or bytes, to the maximum size of
document that you wish to have sent in a single message.  For example:

     LINE-LIMIT: 1000         or          BYTE-LIMIT: 25K

The Info-Server will break the documents at exactly the specified number
of lines, or at the line preceeding the specified number of bytes.  The
minimum limit is 250 lines or 19000 bytes.  You may use the form '25000'
or '25K' in either limit, but NOT '25,000'.  The limit affects only
lines up to the next REQUEST: line.

You should set your limit at least 5K lower than the limit set by your
gateway to allow for added header lines.


         INTERNET, LEASED-LINE, X25NET AND DIAL-UP IP USERS

You may use the file transfer protocol, 'ftp', to retrieve documents
from SH.CS.NET.  Log in as 'anonymous' with password 'guest'.
                                                                        
Info documents and copies of the CSNET-FORUM are individual files in     
the directory 'info'.  For example, a copy of CSNET-FORUM V1 #10 has     
The pathname 'info/forum1-10'.  (This is a Unix host, so type all        
filenames in lowercase.)                                                
                                                                        
RFCs (e.g., RFC822) are in 'rfc' (e.g., 'rfc/rfc822.txt'), and sources
are in 'sources'.  

A single topic may be split up into multiple files, in which case the
document name may be a directory, and the individual files in the
directory will have names such as 'part01'.

The mod.sources documents are also available from sh.cs.net by
anonymous FTP, in the directory 'mod.sources', which contains the
usbdirectories 'volume1', 'volume2', etc.  These documents are also
available as compressed files, ending with '.Z', on the host
uunet.uu.net.
