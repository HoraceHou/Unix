                     REGISTER BY ELECTRONIC MAIL

If no host computer at the CSNET member site runs the Local Agent
Software, the CSNET Technical Liaison can arrange to have the
registrations performed by the CSNET Coordination and Information
Center (CIC) by sending a message to cic@sh.cs.net, or telephoning the
CIC at 617/497-2777.

The information for users to be registered should be sent in a message
addressed to cic@sh.cs.net.  Tables ns-6.1 and ns-6.2 show sample
registrations for multiple names.  The field names, such as "Account",
"MBox", etc., should start in column 1 of the body of the message.
The field contents should start in column 2.  The User Name Server
will turn the space in column 1 into a tab, so lines should be no more
than 72 characters long.  

You may put as many registrations as you wish in a message -- just
separate them with a row of hyphens or some other marker.

The tables show the MBox (MailBox) addresses for sites with
domain-style names.  All Internet now have domain-style names, and
CSNET PhoneNet sites have either converted to the domain system, or
are in the process of doing so.  (For more information about
domain-style names, see REFERENCES at the end of this document.)

The purpose of the Account string is to provide a unique identifier
for each person registered in the User Name Server.  It has the form

	user,host,site

Before the Internet domain name system was adopted, the designers of
the User Name Server, intended the "host" string to be the name of
the user's host computer, and the "site" string to be a unique name
assigned by CSNET to the CSNET member organization.

Now that the Internet domain name system assigns unique hierarchical
names, the Account string should incorporate the domain names in some
reasonable way.

"User", "host" and "site" are just strings of characters, as far as
the User Name Server is concerned.  As long as we don't end up with
duplicate Account strings, the exact scheme used to form the Account
string doesn't matter very much.  Here are some suggestions:

    1.  The "user" string should be the user's login name, or the
	name under which he or she receives mail.

    2.  The domain name assigned to an entire organization consists
	of a second-level domain unique to the organization, followed
	by one of the top-level domains such as ".edu" or "com".
	For example, AAA College might have the domain name
	"aaa.edu".

        If outsiders can send mail to anyone at the site, for example,
	"aaa.edu"  by using the address "user@aaa.edu", the Account
	string can be

		user,aaa.edu,aaa.edu

    3.  If outsiders must know the name of a lower-level domain --
        which might be the name of a department within the
	organization -- the lower-level domain can be placed in the
	"host" string, and the domain for the organization should be
	in the "site" string.  For example, a user in the Computer
	Science Department of ZZZ University might have the Account:

		user,cs.zzz.edu,zzz.edu

	But if addresses must be specified down to the name of an
	individual host computer, you can use hostnames, too.  You
	might include the full domain name of the computer:

		user,zebra.cs.zzz.edu,zzz.edu

	Or, if you can guarantee that there is no other "zebra" in
	"zzz.edu", you might use just the host name as it is used on
	the internal network:

		user,zebra,zzz.edu
