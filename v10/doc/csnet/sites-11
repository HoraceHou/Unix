                         ACSNET (AUSTRALIA) SITES

Update Note (15 Jan 86): The top-level domain for Australia is AU, and
its domain server is seismo.css.gov.  

Messages sent to user@host.oz.au are delivered via seismo.css.gov.
Messages sent to user%australia.csnet@relay.cs.net and
user%host.oz@relay.cs.net are delivered via relay.cs.net.  The munnari
host calls both seismo.css.gov and relay.cs.net, but makes contact with
seismo more frequently.

The detailed and comprehensive site list promised below has not yet been
compiled  -- it is a diffibult task because the network itself is distributed
and changes frequently..  Send inquiries about specific addresses to
postmaster%australia.csnet@relay.cs.net or postmaster@munnari.oz.au.

Subject: acsnet node list

We are registering as a top level country domain [.au] have made 
arrangements with, I think,  ucbvax to be our nameserver [domain server]. 

At the moment a more detailed list of sites is being prepared but I imagine
that will not be available for a month or two so I [have] sent you a copy of
our acsnet site list. The list only contains node name, domains it is in,
and optionally a descriptive string
...the domain in the '{', '}' bracket
is the full domain address, not all of which are always necessary. The other
domains are the domains which the node is in and directly accessible. i.e.
mulga's full address is mulga.cs.mu.oz but since we are in the 'mu' domain
cs is not neccessary, shortening things to 'mulga.mu.oz'. Actually we are
in the oz domain as well so only mulga.oz is really necessary. 'oz' is the
top level domain in acsnet.

   We will send over the detailed site list when it is prepared...

                                                andrew

[More explanation from Robert Elz <kre@munnari.oz>, 3 Jun 85.
This came with a previous list. ]

I believe that all nodes are reachable over CSNET as

	user@host.oz

alternatively, user%host.oz@csnet-relay also gets to them, as
should user%host.oz@seismo or munnari!host.oz!user@seismo.

Its probable that user%host.oz@australia.csnet and
user%host.oz%australia.csnet@csnet-relay work too,
but I would not encourage the use of "australia"
(munnari's actual csnet host name I believe) for
anything other than mail to "postmaster@australia"
for people who know they want to get to australia
but don't know anything much more than that.

"Host" in all these cases sometimes includes more domains.

Node & domain names should be case independent, but not
all nodes are running that code yet, so using lower-case is
best.  User names are generally case dependant (this network
is mostly made up of Unix machines).

Many of these sites are "pure Unix" type places (or like to
think that they are) and don't support such radical ideas as
having a mail address "postmaster" or anything like that.
Mail to "root" is usually the best that you can hope.  (Of
course, some of them aren't Unix at all, and have no "root",
and often no "postmaster" either.  Never mind.) ...

The name at the left margin is the node name.  The list in
braces following it is its domain hierarchy, so, taking the
[aeec] node in the list, "aeec" - its full name is "aaec.aaec.oz".
The hierarchy should always end in "oz".

The first name in the brackets indicates the "primary" domain
of the node.  Eg, for "aaec" it is "oz".  That means that
aaec can be properly addressed as "aaec.oz".  On the other
hand, "basser40" has "su" as its primary, so while its full
name is "basser40.cs.su.oz" that can be abbreviated to
"basser40

Nodes that don't supply this list of names are running VERY old code
(before domains existed) and are all implicitly just in "oz".  Finally,
everything in this list (because it is in the list) can be addressed as
if its name were "host.oz" regardless of whether that's what its name
really is or not.  Other domains listed in brackets indicate the amount
of information that the node keeps in its statefile (ie, which nodes
are directly addressible from it) and aren't immediately relevant.
Ignore "acsnet", it has nothing to do with anything (and never occurs
in a hierarchy - or shouldn't).

Words in parentheses relate to issues not pertinent to
anything material here.

The second line, when there is one, for each node, gives
some human-useful indication as to what the node is,
or at least, that is the intention.

Finally, note that this info changes all the time ...
