==============================================================================

Dear CSNET Member:

Please complete the application at the end of this message and return
the CSNET CIC by U.S. Mail or by EMail to cic@sh.cs.net.  We will send
your application to the NIC and notify you when the registration is
completed.

The name that you choose for your organization should conform to the
Domain Naming System adopted by the Defense Data Network (DDN).

The DDN is composed of the ARPANET, an experimental research and
development network, and the MILNET, an operational military network.
The Internet is composed of the DDN, plus other networks that share the
same protocols, including the CSNET X25Net and NSFNET Regional Networks.

CSNET PhoneNet sites can exchange electronic messages with the Internet
through RELAY.CS.NET, which also connects PhoneNet sites to each other,
and to other networks, public and private.

In the past, the addresses used by the DDN were based upon individual
host computers (as were the addresses used by most other multi-computer
neworks).  The domain system is different -- it sets up the
organization, not the physical hardware, as the basic unit.  All users
at the same organization have addresses in the same domain, regardless
of the hardware they use or the route used to deliver their messages.

Domain names for organizations must be registered with the Network
Information Center (NIC) of the DDN.  The CSNET CIC has arranged with
the DDN NIC to take care of the registration process for PhoneNet sites.

The information that is required to translate domain names into routes
between hosts is stored on Internet host computers in dynamic database
programs called "domain servers".  CSNET PhoneNet sites cannot run their
own domain servers, since they do not have direct real-time access to
the Internet; instead, they must arrange with Internet hosts to perform
this function.  The CSNET CIC runs a domain server on RELAY.CS.NET, with
a backup on SH.CS.NET, and offers to be the domain server for any
PhoneNet site that needs this service.

Domain names are organized in a hierarchical tree structure.  At the top
is a set of top-level domain names chosen and administered by the DDN
NIC.  The top-level domains for the United States represent classes of
organizations:

    COM  Commercial organizations     MIL  Department of Defense
    EDU  Educational organizations    NET  Administrative organizations 
    GOV  Civilian government               for networks, e.g., CSNET.
    ORG  Nonprofit organizations      ARPA Temporary top-level domain, 

Non-US countries have their own top-level domains, named for the
2-letter country codes of the International Standards Organization (ISO
standard 3166), for example, AU (Australia), NZ (New Zealand), IL
(Israel) and UK (United Kingdom).  If your organization is based in a
country other than the United States, you should contact the CSNET CIC
for information about your top-level domain.

Second-level domains represent individual organizations.  Hypothetical
examples of domains for organizations might be:

            OXBRIDGE.EDU            Oxbridge University
	    WIDGETS.COM             Widgets Mfg. Co., Inc.
    	    THINKTANK.ORG           The Thinktank Institute

Each CSNET site should form its domain name by selecting the appropriate
top-level domain, and choosing a second-level domain.  The CSNET CIC
will check the combination to make sure that it is unique.

Once your organization has been registered as a second-level domain, you
may freely create lower-level domains, according to your needs.

The pattern for an electronic mail address is:

            user@domain             

where "domain" is a string of words separated by periods.  Lower-level
domains are arranged left to right in, ascending order of level.  The
domain ends with a top-level domain.  Any number of lower-level domains
may be used.

A domain may represent a subdivision of an organization (at any level),
or an individual host computer.

Examples of addresses might be:

laura@oxbridge.edu              Oxbridge.edu either has no subdomains, 
			        or hides its subdomains.
diane@eng.oxbridge.edu          Engineering Dept within oxbridge.edu.
dennis@ai.cs.oxbridge.edu       AI project in the Computer Science Dept.
craig@wk15.cc.oxbridge.edu      Workstation in the Computer Center.

If you have further questions about domains, please send a message to 
cic@sh.cs.net, or call the CSNET CIC Hotline at (617)497-2777.






          APPLICATION FOR A SECOND-LEVEL DOMAIN FOR A CSNET MEMBER


   1)  ORGANIZATION NAME

   What is your organization's name?   _____________________________________
   Example: "Oxbridge University"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2)  DOMAIN NAME

   What domain name do you want?     _______________________________________
   Example: "OXBRIDGE.EDU" 

   In general, the NIC strongly encourages you to keep the second-level
   domain name (e.g., OXBRIDGE) down to 12 characters.  Technically, the
   names can be much longer, but long names are hard to type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3)  OTHER NETWORKS AT SITE.

   Is there a local electronic mail 
   network within your organization?  ______________________________________

   Please give the approximate number of host computers.   _________________

   Does your organization have connections to other networks that can
   access the Internet by electronic mail, such as the ARPANET/MILNET,
   an NSFNET Regional Network, UUCP, or BITNET?  Please give the
   network, the department of your organization, and the names of the
   principal host or hosts.  Example: Example: "Our computer science
   department has the UUCP host "oxbridge-vax", and our campus
   computing center has the BITNET host "OXBRVM".


           _________________________________________________________________

           _________________________________________________________________

           _________________________________________________________________

           _________________________________________________________________

   Have you reached an agreement about your domain name with the 
   people in your organization who are concerned with other networks?

							      --------------

   You should be aware that the NIC will expect the CSNET Administrative
   and Technical Liaisons at your site to act as domain liaisons for the
   second-level domain at your organization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4)  DOMAIN SERVERS

   Do you want CSNET to run your domain servers for you?      ______________

   If you are a CSNET PhoneNet site, you should answer yes, unless you
   have already made arrangements with another larger organization.
   At any time in the future, you can easily change domain servers.

   If you want to register through CSNET but intend to use a domain
   server other than RELAY.CS.NET, please include the names of the
   Internet hosts that have agreed to act as your domain servers.
