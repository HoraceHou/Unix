To translate a Pascal program without executing it, put it in a file
whose name ends in the characters ".p", i.e. "prog.p".  The command
	pascal -c prog.p
will translate the program into interpreter code which will be left in the
file "obj" in the current directory.  This code can be executed by typing
	obj
or
	pascal -x
The "pascal" command without the -c or -x argument can be used
for load and go Pascal.
The complete command line syntax for pascal -x is
	pascal -x [ -blnpstuw ] [ -i file ... ] name.p
Refer to the UNIX Pascal User's Manual for more details.
