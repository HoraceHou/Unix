To translate and execute a Pascal program, place the source in a file
whose name ends in the characters ".p", i.e. "prog.p".  The command
	pascal prog.p
will translate the program into interpreter code which will be then be executed
If there are compilation errors `E', then execution will be suppressed.
To create a permanent "obj" file which you can interpret, use the
"-c" option.  Type "pascal -c" for more information.

The complete command line syntax for pascal is
	pascal [ -blnpstuw ] [ -i file ... ] name.p [ arg ... ]
Here the trailing arguments are passed to your Pascal program.
This command is equivalent to
	pascal -c [ -blnpstuw ] [ -i file ... ] name.p
and then
	pascal -x scratch [ arg ... ]
where scratch is a temporary file which is then removed.

The command "man pascal" will give more information.
Refer to the UNIX Pascal User's Manual for more details.
