This is a hacked-down version of Post 4.0 for Research Unix systems.
You don't get mailx source (who wants it anyway?) or upas source
(you have it already).

It installs in /usr/bin:
	pq	the post query program
	post	post interface for mailers and trivia; usage is:
		-S	to send an update to the directory
		-D	for directory tidbits (pretty silly)
		-x	called from upas/rewrite to hook into mail
		otherwise, it just execs /bin/mail

In /usr/lib/post:
	dispatch  list of addresses of the post servers; used by pq and post
	update	-S shell script
	dbinfo	-D shell script

The contents of "rewrite" should be put in /usr/lib/upas/rewrite,
usually near the top, depending on how your upas is set up.
You can send mail by name (or any query), but by not using mailx,
you don't get the interactive resolution script in case you get
a name wrong.  You'll get some mail back instead, assuming you have
the newer upas with the post tweak that sends stderr back instead of
"broken translate".

Contact Michael.Scott.Baldwin to shower praise, make death threats, whatever.
