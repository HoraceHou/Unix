Library is a program that allows the electronic ordering of most items
handled by the library networks. Engineering records are not part of
the library network (cent7911) but are also handled.
  The new version (3.2 and up) is mainly table driven so the material/requests
handled by library(1) can be modified without C coding changes.

  library(1) works by mailing requests to mhuxd!techlib.  Requests
are dealt with automatically there: i.e. distributed to the 
appropriate people or systems in order to be filled.  They are handled
frequently (presently every 10 minutes) so responses from Diana (mhuxd)
ought to be fairly rapid.

  library(1) works (or will be fixed to work) on any version of UNIX
on any hardware configuration. The main constraint is that the system
does electronic mail and there is some path from the local system to mhuxd.

  library(1) is fully supported by the AT&T Library Network.
