  library(1) works by mailing requests to mhuxd!techlib. Under the new
version (3.2 and up) this is mainly table driven by the files installed in 
	INSLIB=/usr/lib/library
Change the Makefile if you want this elsewhere.
 
 One possible problem is if mail(1) does not go between your machine 
and mhuxd. Please test this when library(1) is installed
(try sending mail to mhuxd!your-machine!LOGIN).
  library(1) will respond over the path it receives things. The mail path
is indicated on line ~15 in library.c  Presently it is mhuxd!techlib.
Feel free to add hops in the middle (e.g. xyz1!mhuxd!techlib). However,
note that the more links in the path the slower and less reliable the mail.

     *********    NOTE     (especially non-BTL administrators)  ********
Some things orderable by library only really work for BTL people. If you
and/or your users run into this you may simply want to remove the option.
In most cases this can be done by removing or changing a file in 
/usr/lib/library

    **********  NOTE for BSD systems   ***************
There is a special CFLAGS commented out in the Makefile for you. See gnamef.h
for its effects.  Also, you may have to swipe <regexp.h> from a system V
machine.
