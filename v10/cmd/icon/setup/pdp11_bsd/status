Version 6.0 has been installed and tested at the University of Arizona
on a PDP-11/44 running Version 7.  This configuration file was derived
from the Version 7 one and has not yet been tested.

Bugs:

	Overflow checking on multiplication does not work.

	Run-time Error 302 may occur (masking a segmentation
	fault that appears to be a storage allocation bug).

Notes:

	The co-expression context switch is implemented, but as with
	all computers with small address spaces, the use of co-expressions
	is limited.
