Version 6.0 has been installed and tested at the University of Arizona
on a PDP-11/44 running Version 7.

Bugs:

	Overflow checking on multiplication does not work.

	The amount of memory available to Icon really is not enough
	to allow running very large programs, ones that recurse deeply,
	or ones that use a lot of co-expressions.  An inadequate amount
	of memory usually appears in the form of run-time error messages,
	but program malfunction is possible.
