Version 6.0 has been installed and tested at the University of Arizona
on a 3B5 without floating-point hardware.

The 3B5 confguration should run on the 3B2 and 3B15, but
these have not been tested.

Bugs:

	Co-expressions work on simple cases, but in complex situations,
	memory faults have been encountered.

Notes:

	The -f flags given here for the Makefiles may cause warning
	messages on computers with floating-point hardware, but they
	should not affect the results of compilation.
