A preliminary release of Version 6 was installed and tested at the
University of Arizona on an IBM AT running MicroSoft XENIX Version 3.
The implementation is a small-memory-model one.

The configuration information given here is believed to be correct, but
it has not been tested recently.

Missing feature:

	arithmetic overflow checking

Notes:

	Some problems were encountered on tests that used a large
	amount of memory space. These may be due to the way addresses
	are handled by the XENIX compiler, or they may indicate
	problems in the implementation.

	Although the co-expression context switch is implemented,
	as with all systems with small address spaces, the use of
	co-expressions is limited.
