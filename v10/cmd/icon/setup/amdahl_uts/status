Version 6.0 of Icon has been installed at AT&T-IS site on an Amdahl
580 running System V, but there is some confusion about possible operating
system differences. 

The configuration information and co-expression context switch were
provided by that site.

Missing features:

	arithmetic overflow checking


Known bugs:

	Co-expressions do not always work correctly; something seems to
	be wrong with return from the main procedure if co-expressions
	are used.

	There are various problems with floating-point arithmetic. In
	particular, integer(2.0) produces 1, and so forth.
