Version 6.0 of Icon has not yet been installed on a VAX-11 running
UNIX System V.  The configuration information here is a best guess, taken from
that for the AT&T 3B5 running under System V.

The co-expression context switch included here is a copy of the
one for the VAX-11 running under Berkley UNIX 4.3bsd.  It may be
that other registers need to be saved and restored.
