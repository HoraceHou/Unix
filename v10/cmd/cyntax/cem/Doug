/n/bowell/usr/src/cmd/cyntax/cem/Doug:
My Xmas present to 1127:

On bowell, do these (after whatever state-preservation you care to):

	mv /usr/lib/cyntax/ncem		/usr/lib/cyntax/cem
	mv /usr/lib/cyntax/nccom	/usr/lib/cyntax/ccom
	mv /usr/lib/cyntax/ncyntax	/usr/bin/cyntax
	mv /usr/lib/cyntax/lint.1	/usr/man/man1/lint.1
	mv /usr/lib/cyntax/nlibc	/usr/lib/cyntax/libc
	mv /usr/lib/cyntax/nlibj	/usr/lib/cyntax/libj
	mv /usr/lib/cyntax/nlibipc	/usr/lib/cyntax/libipc

I guess all of these files except for lint.1 should be shipped.

I don't know how to make libg and libk.  Tom K. recently remade libg 
without using the Makefile; he should be told to remake it.

Here is a draft press release:

New version of cyntax & libraries installed.  Send bugs to reeds.

Cosmetic changes:
A few undocumented flags removed from cyntax front end.  
A few undocumented useful-seeming flags now documented.
New -n flag added to suppress checking against standard
library, a -d debugging flag added to amuse the curious.
Errors in initializers are treated differently.

Substantive changes:
Name space logic changed to make cyntax react civily 
(but sternly) to

	struct alpha *x;
	union alpha *y;
	fred(){
		y = (union alpha*)x;
	}

which it now regards as illegal C instead of excuse to core
dump.

Format of .O files changed, so that 
	
	enum{
		Nenv=256,
		EOL=-1,
	};
	int	envtab[Nenv];

does not cause cem to freak out as it did.  Your .O files
will have to be recreated.
