README         This file.
src/           Directory for all *.f, *.c, *.s and *.o files.
makefile       Makes MATLAB.
mathelp.dac    Direct access version of the HELP file.
mathelp.idx    Index to the direct access HELP file.

The make file will put MATLAB in /usr/local/bin/MATLAB.
If you want it someplace else, change the last line of makefile.

The two direct access help files, mathelp.dac and mathelp.idx, should
be moved to /usr/local/lib so they can be accessed by MATLAB.
If you want to put them someplace else, edit file  src/files.f .

install        Installation guide, for UNIX and other systems.
help           The help source document.
helpset.f      Main program to create mathelp.dac and mathelp.idx.
demo           When in MATLAB, try  exec('demo') .
doc            The Users' Guide.
doc.n          The nroff source for the Users' Guide.

bugs4.1/       Directory of fixes to old versions of Berkeley 4.1.
buildmat       Builds files mat and mat.sngl from some *.f files in src.
buildlib       Builds files lib and lib.sngl from some *.f files in src.
buildhelper    Builds file helper.77.
buildsys       Builds file sys.unix from some *.f files in src.
